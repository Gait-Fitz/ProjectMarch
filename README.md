# Project MARCH
![Pipeline Status](https://gitlab.com/project-march/march/badges/main/pipeline.svg)

Project MARCH is a student team of the TU Delft that is involved in the development of
a user-friendly and versatile exoskeleton, a motorized robotic suit, that can be used
to get people with a spinal cord injury to stand up and walk again. This repository
contains the code to make this happen.

## Framework
All code is built on top of the Robot Operating System (ROS). More information about ROS can be found on https://www.ros.org/about-ros/.

## Installation and usage
- To install required ROS enviroment, please follow the [Install ROS and tools](https://docs.projectmarch.nl/doc/getting_started/install_ros_and_tools.html) instructions.
- To build and run the code, please follow the [Setup your workspace](https://docs.projectmarch.nl/doc/getting_started/setup_your_workspace.html) instructions.

## Documentation
All documentation can be found at https://docs.projectmarch.nl

## Contributing
At the moment, it is not possible to contribute to the code base without explicit permission from Project MARCH. We hope to change this as soon as possible.

## License
At the moment, Project MARCH has no explicit license. We are working on an open source
license for the code base. You can keep track of the current state of this proces [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/project-march/-/epics/3).
