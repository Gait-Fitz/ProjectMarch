Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
SMACH is a task-level architecture for rapidly creating complex robot behavior.
At its core, SMACH is a ROS-independent Python library to build hierarchical state machines.

SMACH makes it easy to get an overview of the behaviour of the exoskeleton.
It includes a visualization called the Introspection Server.

SMACH is well documented on the `ros wiki <http://wiki.ros.org/smach>`_.
If you have to work with SMACH, make sure you have completed all their tutorials first.
