march_moveit
============

Overview
--------
The march_moveit package is the package that contains all files necessary for the integration of
`MoveIt <https://moveit.ros.org/>`_. MoveIt is an open source project that is the result of the combined efforts
of a large international community and multiple organizations.MoveIt is a framework for everything that has to do
with motion planning. There are a lot of `tutorials <https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/>`_ on the project.

We started using MoveIt for implementing capture point. More information on that is in :ref:`march-gait-selection-label`.
Here we use the `Python MoveIt Commander <http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/moveit_commander/html/index.html>`_ as the interface to MoveIt.
The integration allows to use MoveIt for all kinds of dynamic gaits. Manually editing the files in this packages is not
recommended. The files are auto-generated by the setup-assistant.

ROS API
-------

The packages has a very extensive ROS API, because MoveIt is very well integrated with ROS. This will not all be listed
here as most of it is only used by MoveIt itself. An important thing to not is that MoveIt can publish position and
velocity commands directly to the controller. We are avoiding this, because we want to stay in control.
