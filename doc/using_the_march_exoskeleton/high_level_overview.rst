Simulation versus Exoskeleton
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As our exoskeleton is under construction most of the time, we have made use of
a simulation to ensure we can verify our higher level nodes work. As seen in
the above image, most of the hardware components have a simulated counterpart.

When launching, the user can choose whether to launch the simulation or the
hardware. See :ref:`march-launch-label` for more information on launching the
exoskeleton.
