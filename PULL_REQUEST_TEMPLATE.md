<!--
To streamline the process of creating and reviewing pull requests, we have created a template.
It is not required to follow this template perfectly, but we encourage you to think about each header.
-->

## Issues
<!--
Link to affected issues, use waffle keywords if applicable.
https://help.waffle.io/faq/waffle-workflow/use-waffles-connect-keyword-to-connect-prs-to-issues

Example:
```
Closes #1
Connects #2
```
-->

## Description
<!--
Provide a quick description on the feature/fix your branch implements.

Example:
```
Add rqt to use as a framework for data-logging and sending commands to ros.
Multiple ui's are launched in the main.launch file. You can toggle these with commandline arguments.
```
-->

## Features
<!--
A bulletpoint list of all features you've added (should include all features in the closing issues).

Example:
```
- Add rqt to dependencies
- Provide an example layout which is automatically loaded.
- Made rqt configureable in the launch file
```
-->

## Documentation
<!--
Provide a clear overview of documentation that needs to be added/changed. Provide links to affected articles and explain what should change.
Try to be as precise as possible, nobody likes outdated documentation.

Example:
```
Add a page [[ROS visualization with rqt]] which explains how rqt will be used and how you can customize its perspectives.
On the page [[ROS bag]] at line 24, the reference to the rqt_perspectives is outdated and should be changed to the new file location.
```
